FLUI is an Open Source widget kit for [Flutter](https://www.luizeof.com.br/) that has many high quality UI widgets, providing more advanced features and functions to improve development efficiency.

Widgets are MaterialApp compliant and non-styled support style customization to meet different interface needs. You can follow the development of FLUI in the [official Github repository.](https://github.com/Rannie/flui/)

User actions generate clear feedback on UI elements, and users can perceive states through interface interaction.

## Flutter SDK

Use o Flutter SDK >= v1.12.13+hotfix.5

FLUI has good multi-client compatibility and the framework will be developed based on the Flutter Stable Channel.

Due to the rapid development of the Flutter framework, new widgets will be introduced continuously and some issues will be fixed in the plugin.

Therefore, FLUI will follow the official version of Flutter to update as much as possible, and when there are destructive API updates, it will also be stated in the official plugin documentation.
